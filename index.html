    <p class="sectionTag text-big">What is Education?</p>
    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acuisition of
      knowledge, skills, values, beliefs and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling,
      discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however
      learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience
      that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of
      teaching is called pedagogy.

    <p class="sectionTag text-big">History of Education</p>
    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In ancient India, education was mainly imparted through the Vedic and Buddhist
      education system. Sanskrit was the language used to impart the Vedic education system. Pali was the language used
      in the Buddhist education system. In the Vedic system, a child started his education at the age of 8 to 12,
      whereas in the Buddhist system the child started his education at the age of eight. The main aim of education in
      ancient India was to develop a person's character, master the art of self-control, bring about social awareness,
      and to conserve and take forward ancient culture.

    <p class="sectionTag text-big">Let's grow Together</p>
    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education plays various roles in society, including in social, economic, and
      personal fields. On a social level, education makes it possible to establish and sustain a stable society. It
      helps individuals acquire the basic skills needed to interact with their environment and fulfill their basic needs
      and desires. Children are socialized into society by acquiring these skills. Another key part of socialization is
      to learn how to live in social groups and interact with others by coming to
      understand the social and cultural norms and expectations. This requires an understanding of what kinds of
      behavior are considered appropriate in different contexts. This way, new members are introduced to the culture,
      norms, and values that are dominant in their society.
